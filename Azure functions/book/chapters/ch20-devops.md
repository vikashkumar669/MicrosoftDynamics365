## The business problem

Harbourline's old integration was deployed by copying files to a server on Friday evenings. Each environment had drifted: settings typed by hand, a firewall rule added in a hurry, a storage key nobody could trace. When test passed and production failed, nobody could say what was different.

The goal: environments created from the same code, releases that need no one's password, and a deployment that users don't notice.

## How it works

### Infrastructure as code with Bicep

**Bicep** is Azure's declarative language for resources. A template states what should exist; Azure Resource Manager makes it so, creating or updating resources. Running the same template with `environmentName=test` and `environmentName=prod` produces environments that differ only where parameters say they should.

### Flex Consumption specifics

A Flex Consumption app is a `Microsoft.Web/sites` resource on a `FC1` plan, with its behaviour in a `functionAppConfig` section: the **deployment storage** container that holds the code package, the runtime and version, instance memory, maximum instance count, and the **site update strategy**. There are no deployment slots on Flex. Instead, the `RollingUpdate` strategy drains instances in batches while new instances start with the new version; in-progress executions finish, within the usual limits. Microsoft's documentation lists caveats worth knowing: the platform controls batch sizes and timing, there is no progress indicator or built-in rollback, a one-instance app still sees a brief gap, and changes must work alongside the previous version while the update rolls.

### Pipelines without secrets

**OpenID Connect (OIDC)** lets GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines get an Azure token by presenting a short-lived token issued by the CI system. In Entra ID you add a **federated credential** to an app registration (or user-assigned managed identity) that trusts, for example, `repo:<owner>/<repo>:environment:prod`. Nothing secret is stored in GitHub: the repository only knows the client, tenant and subscription IDs.

## Architecture

::: {#tbl:components caption="Deployment components"}
| Component | Role | Authenticates with | Failure path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `infra/main.bicep` | Every Azure resource and role | Pipeline identity (Contributor + User Access Administrator on the resource group) | Deployment fails, nothing half-changed in a resource |
| GitHub workflow | Build once, deploy three times | OIDC federated credential per environment | Job fails; later environments don't run |
| GitHub environments | Approvals and variables | Required reviewers | Release waits |
| Dataverse solution | Schema and app changes | Power Platform build tools | Import fails; Azure release not started |
:::

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 5, 11, 12, 14 and 18: the resources the template creates are explained there.
- Owner rights on the target resource groups (once, to grant the pipeline identity its roles).

## Step-by-step implementation

### Step 1 – Storage that accepts identities only

```{.bicep #lst:storage include="infra/main.bicep" region="bicep-storage" caption="A storage account with shared keys disabled"}
```

`allowSharedKeyAccess: false` means no connection string with a key works against this account. The host, the deployment container and the feed triggers all use the app's identity; Bicep later grants the roles they need.

### Step 2 – The plan and the app

```{.bicep #lst:plan include="infra/main.bicep" region="bicep-plan" caption="A Flex Consumption plan"}
```

```{.bicep #lst:site include="infra/main.bicep" region="bicep-site" caption="The Function App: identity, deployment container, scale, runtime and settings"}
```

1. A system-assigned identity, created with the app.
2. Code packages are stored in the `deployments` container, read with that identity.
3. The maximum instance count is a parameter: the number you multiplied by concurrency in Chapter 2.
4. Rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments.
5. Secrets appear only as Key Vault references, built by a small Bicep function. The secret values are set once, by a person, in Key Vault; they are never in the template, the pipeline or the repository.

The app settings use identity-based forms: `AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName`, `ServiceBus__fullyQualifiedNamespace`, `FeedStorage__blobServiceUri`. Not one connection string with a key.

### Step 3 – Grant the identity its roles

```{.bicep #lst:roles include="infra/main.bicep" region="bicep-roles" caption="Role assignments for the app's identity"}
```

Role assignment names are GUIDs derived from the scope, the app and the role, so redeploying doesn't create duplicates. The Durable Task Scheduler's role ID is a parameter: look it up once with `az role definition list --name "Durable Task Data Contributor"`, rather than trusting a GUID copied from a blog. The template also creates the Service Bus entities (Chapter 11), Key Vault with RBAC, Application Insights with local authentication disabled, and the scheduler and task hub.

### Step 4 – Set up OIDC

For each environment:

1. Create an app registration (or user-assigned identity) `hlconnect-deploy-<env>`.
2. Add a federated credential: issuer `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, subject `repo:<owner>/<repo>:environment:<env>`.
3. Grant it *Contributor* and *User Access Administrator* (or *Role Based Access Control Administrator*, constrained to the roles in the template) on `rg-hlconnect-<env>`.
4. In GitHub, create environments `dev`, `test` and `prod`; add required reviewers to `test` and `prod`; set variables `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `RESOURCE_GROUP` and `DATAVERSE_URL` per environment.

### Step 5 – The workflow

```{.yaml #lst:workflow include="../.github/workflows/azure-functions-deploy.yml" caption="Build once, deploy to dev, test and prod"}
```

The build job tests and publishes once; the deploy job runs per environment, in order (`max-parallel: 1`), each waiting for its environment's approval. `azure/login` exchanges the GitHub token for an Azure token; `az deployment group create` applies the Bicep; `Azure/functions-action` uploads the package to the deployment container and starts the rolling update; the smoke test calls `/api/health` until it answers or gives up. The workflow starts manually until the environments are configured; Chapter 25's checklist turns on the push trigger.

### Step 6 – The Azure DevOps alternative

```{.yaml #lst:ado include="pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml" caption="The same flow in Azure Pipelines"}
```

Use a service connection with **workload identity federation**, the Azure DevOps equivalent of OIDC, and an **environment** with approvals and checks. For Flex Consumption, `AzureFunctionApp@2` needs `appType: functionAppLinux` and `isFlexConsumption: true`; version 1 of the task doesn't support Flex.

### Step 7 – Ship Dataverse changes as solutions

The schema from Chapter 4 reaches test and production as a **managed solution**, never by running the setup tool. Export the `HarbourlineConnect` solution from development with the Power Platform CLI (`pac solution export`), keep the unpacked source in the repository (`pac solution unpack`), and import it in the pipeline with the Power Platform Build Tools before the Azure deployment. Environment-specific values, such as the webhook URL, go in **environment variables** and **connection references** in the solution, set per environment at import.

Order matters: schema first, then code that uses it. Make changes backward compatible (add columns before code uses them, stop using them before removing them) so that rolling updates and staggered imports never meet an incompatible pair.

### Step 8 – Roll back

There are no slots to swap. To roll back, redeploy the previous build's artifact through the same pipeline, which starts another rolling update. Keep build artifacts for at least as long as you might need them, and tag releases in Git so "the previous version" is unambiguous. For data changes, roll *forward*: a fix is safer than reversing a migration.

## Screens you will use

::: {.capture #fig:fedcred caption="A federated credential trusting one GitHub environment." app="Microsoft Entra admin center" path="App registrations › hlconnect-deploy-prod › Certificates & secrets › Federated credentials" annotations="1 Issuer; 2 Subject: repo:…:environment:prod; 3 No client secrets"}
:::

::: {.capture #fig:approval caption="A production deployment waiting for approval." app="GitHub" path="Actions › azure-functions-deploy › run › deploy (prod)" annotations="1 Waiting for review; 2 Required reviewers; 3 Approve and deploy"}

:::

## Complete working code

- `infra/main.bicep`, `infra/apim.bicep` and `infra/apim/*`
- `.github/workflows/azure-functions-book.yml` (CI) and `azure-functions-deploy.yml` (CD)
- `pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml`

## Configuration

::: {#tbl:settings caption="Pipeline variables per GitHub environment"}
| Variable | Example | Secret? |
|---|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Deploy identity's client ID | No |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Tenant ID | No |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Subscription ID | No |
| `RESOURCE_GROUP` | `rg-hlconnect-test` | No |
| `DATAVERSE_URL` | `https://harbourline-test.crm11.dynamics.com` | No |
:::

## Sample input and output

```text
deploy (test)  Waiting for approval from @integration-leads
  ✓ Sign in to Azure (OIDC)
  ✓ Infrastructure      func-hlconnect-test-k3q7…
  ✓ Deploy code
  ✓ Smoke test          /api/health → 200
```

(Illustrative output.)

## Testing

CI compiles every Bicep file on every push, catching syntax and type errors. Before a template change reaches production, run `az deployment group what-if` against test to see exactly which resources would change, and read it as carefully as a code diff.

## Common errors and troubleshooting

::: {#tbl:errors caption="Errors you may see when deploying"}
| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `AADSTS70021`: no matching federated identity record | Subject doesn't match repo, branch or environment | Match the subject exactly |
| Role assignment fails | Pipeline lacks rights to assign roles | Grant *User Access Administrator* or *RBAC Administrator* on the group |
| App starts but can't read storage | Role assignment still propagating | Retry; propagation can take minutes |
| Deployment succeeds, functions missing | Package not in `released-package.zip` form or wrong folder | Deploy with the functions action or `func` |
| Brief errors during a release | One instance only, or incompatible change | Expected with one instance; keep changes backward compatible |
| Key Vault reference unresolved after deploy | Secret not created yet | Create secrets before first deployment |
:::

## Security considerations

::: security
The pipeline's identity can change your production environment: scope it to one resource group, require approvals for test and prod, and protect the workflow files with code owners. Never store Azure credentials in GitHub or Azure DevOps when OIDC or workload identity federation is available.
:::

## Performance and scalability

::: performance
Deploy outside the busiest hours even with rolling updates: draining instances finish work while new ones start, so capacity dips briefly. Keep start-up fast (no network calls in `Program.cs`) so new instances become ready quickly.
:::

## Alternatives and design decisions

Terraform describes the same resources and suits organisations that standardise on it; Bicep was chosen because it is Azure-native and needs no state file. Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) templates can create and deploy Flex apps quickly and are a good start for prototypes. Container deployment to Azure Container Apps is the choice when a team already runs containers (Chapter 2).

## Best practices

- Describe every resource and role in Bicep; never configure production by hand.
- Prefer identity-based settings; disable storage shared keys.
- Authenticate pipelines with OIDC or workload identity federation.
- Build once, promote the same artifact, with approvals and smoke tests.
- Use rolling updates and backward-compatible changes; roll back by redeploying.
- Ship Dataverse changes as managed solutions, schema before code.

## Hands-on exercise

::: exercise
**Goal:** add a staging smoke check that touches Dataverse.

**Steps:** add a `GET /api/health/ready` function that reads one `hl_syncstate` row and returns 200 or 503, exclude it from Easy Auth, and call it from the smoke test after `/api/health`.

**Done when:** a deployment to an environment without the application user fails at the smoke test, not at the first real request.

**Stretch:** add an `az deployment group what-if` step that runs before the infrastructure step in test and prod, and publish its output to the job summary.

## Knowledge check

::: knowledge-check
1. What does `allowSharedKeyAccess: false` force, and why is it safe for this app?
2. How do you roll back a Flex Consumption app without slots?
3. What does a federated credential trust, and what is stored in GitHub?
4. Why does the workflow build once and deploy three times?
5. In which order are Dataverse solutions and Azure code deployed, and why?
:::

Answers are in Appendix G.

::: summary
- Bicep describes the whole environment, identities and roles included; parameters make dev, test and prod.
- Flex Consumption uses a deployment container and rolling updates instead of slots.
- OIDC and workload identity federation remove deployment secrets.
- One artifact moves through approvals and smoke tests; rollback is a redeployment.
- Dataverse changes travel as managed solutions, schema before code.
