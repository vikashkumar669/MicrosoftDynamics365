## Building

```bash
# Needs pandoc 3.x, WeasyPrint, cairosvg, and Mermaid CLI (mmdc) for .mmd figures
book/build/build.sh book/chapters/*.md          # each chapter and appendix
python3 book/figures/make_figures.py             # diagrams (needs ICON_DIR)
python3 book/build/assemble.py                   # whole book: PDF + DOCX
# -> book/out/Azure-Functions-for-Dynamics-365.pdf and .docx
```

Code listings are not typed into chapters by hand: they are pulled from the compiled projects in `../src` by `// <listing id>` region markers, so the printed code always matches code that CI has built.

All companies, products, people and data in the book are fictional.
